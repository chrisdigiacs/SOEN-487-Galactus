# SOEN-487-Galactus

A Weather App built with Vue.js and Node.js as the final project by "L'equipe" for SOEN 487 - Web Services and Applications at Concordia University in Montreal

## Approach

It works utilizing 4 Services:

1) Data Retrieval Service -> Data Ninja

2) Notification Service -> Notify Nexus

3) Visualization/Pre-Render Service -> Visual Voyager

4) Authentication Service -> Cipher Chief

The UI is codenamed Sky Siren
## Setup for the Services and UI
Ensure that when you go into the directory that you are working on, that you do ``npm install`` first to make sure you have all the packages up to date before running ``npm start`` to have the server running (by default will be on localhost:3000)
